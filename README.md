# Rooms

Tried to replicate (with random images downloaded from the web) the Rooms project from the WWDC 2019 session: [Introducing SwiftUI: Building your first App](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/204/).

Note: in order to see the Canvas, you need MacOS Catalina.  There is a workaround that will let you preview the views in a playground.  See [Here](https://ericasadun.com/2019/06/06/good-things-swiftui-on-mojave-in-ios-playgrounds/)
